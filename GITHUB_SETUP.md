# GitHub Repository Setup Checklist

Follow these steps to push your project to GitHub:

## 📝 Pre-Push Checklist

- [ ] `.gitignore` created (excludes node_modules, venv, logs)
- [ ] `README.md` created (project overview)
- [ ] `SETUP.md` created (setup instructions)
- [ ] `setup.bat` created (automated installation)
- [ ] All sensitive data removed (.env should be in .gitignore)
- [ ] Test that `setup.bat` works from clean state

## 🚀 Push to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `flightguard-dapp` (or your choice)
3. Description: "Decentralized Flight Delay Insurance Platform"
4. **Visibility**: Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have our own)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Git (if not already)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\TUF\Desktop\New folder"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: FlightGuard DApp with blockchain integration"
```

### 3. Connect to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flightguard-dapp.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 4. Verify
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Check that files are uploaded
- Verify `.gitignore` is working (no node_modules, venv visible)

## 📤 Share with Your Friend

Send them:
```
Repository URL: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flightguard-dapp

Quick setup:
1. git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flightguard-dapp.git
2. cd flightguard-dapp  
3. setup.bat
4. start_blockchain_full.bat

Done! App runs at http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔐 For Private Repositories

If your repo is private, you need to:
1. Add your friend as collaborator
2. Go to Settings → Collaborators → Add people
3. Enter their GitHub username
4. They'll receive invitation email

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Files EXCLUDED from Git (in .gitignore):
- `node_modules/` - Will be installed by setup.bat
- `venv/` - Will be created by setup.bat
- `*.log` files - Generated at runtime
- `.env` - Contains sensitive data
- `db.sqlite3` - Will be created fresh
- `cache/`, `artifacts/` - Generated by Hardhat

### Files INCLUDED in Git:
- All source code (.js, .jsx, .py, .sol)
- Configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt)
- Documentation (.md files)
- Scripts (.bat files)
- `deployed_addresses.json` - Blockchain config
- `.gitignore`, `.gitkeep` files

## 🧪 Test Before Sharing

**Recommended:** Test the setup process yourself:

1. Make a copy of project to different location
2. Delete `node_modules`, `venv`, `db.sqlite3`
3. Run `setup.bat`
4. Run `start_blockchain_full.bat`
5. Verify everything works

This ensures your friend will have smooth setup!
